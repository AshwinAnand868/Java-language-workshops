Task1 - Designed a class named MaxLocation which has a function to locate a maximum value and its location in a 2-D array. 

Task2 - Created a very small game called Craps.
Specifications were:
• Roll two dice. (Each roll should produce two random numbers between 1 to 6)

• Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, …, and 6 respectively.

• Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (program should display
craps), you lose the game.

• If the sum of the two dice is 7 or 11 (program should display naturals), you win the
game.

• If the sum of two dice is any value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), program should establish
a point in the game (meaning store that sum). Continue to roll the dice until the sum is
either a 7 or the same point value which was established. If rolled sum is 7, you lose the
game. Otherwise, if the rolled sum is equal to established point you win.

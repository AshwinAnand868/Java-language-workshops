Worked with java Threads

Task 1:
Tested the timings by doing matrix addition with two different ways. First way by using sequential process and second way by using threads and dividing the array into 4 equal halfes.

Task 2:
Written a program called ReverseThread.java that creates a thread. That thread then creates an another thread, which creates an another thread and so on. Every thread prints its name and number.
